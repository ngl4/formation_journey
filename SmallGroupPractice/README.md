# Small Group Practice (outside of Formation Schedule)

## Jiyoon Koo, Eric Vo, Steven Zhu (06/14/22) - Algo Marathon ~ rotational programming
- Going through different algo marathon problems and rotate around with different fellows solving different problems. 
- I started solving a `threeSum` problem. We talked about 2 approaches to the problem: 
    - using `twoSum` as an example: 
        - 1. Use two pointers i, j - find difference that match up with the target value by moving the pointers in the same direction 
        - 2. Sort the array + Use two pointers i, j - place the two pointers each on the opposite end of the array and then move the j to the left when the difference is larger than the target value, and move i to the right when the difference is smaller than the target value.
    - Similar approach can be applied to `threeSum` 
    - Want to try it out and explain how you would approach it? 

- Then we go through `Kadane's Algo`, `Linked List - find Kth elem from the end`, and `backtracking - letterCombination` problems.
- Jiyoon, Eric and Steven are going through more problems since I need to start to wrap up my day and get some rest!!
