# Pair Learning in Algo Marathon 

## Brian Do (04/25/22)
- Going through [a Medium array problem](https://github.com/ngl4/formation_journey/blob/main/AlgoMarathon/Arrays/PairLearning/cellTowerswBrian.js)
- KEY TAKEAWAY: Understand a problem and able to describe it, and `to come up with a solution plain English`. Practice doing this more whenever I encounter a problem!!! 

- If the problem is harder than you, it might be best to reach out to the Fellow Manager to lower the difficulty. 

- `Pre-coding` is what I need to focus to practice more and start with `easy` type of problems!! 

- `intuition` - Brian has mentioned this several times during the session. It is really crucial to approach an unknown problem with intuition. This does not come naturally, it comes with practices. 

- Learned about the difference between `||` (falsy) and `??` (nullish) in Javascript 

**Reflection:** 

- I felt uncomfortable working through this problem since it is harder than expected and I had a hard time going through the problem understanding and precoding aspects. 

- Brian has given me several opportunities to pseudocode and code things out, but I still struggle and I can tell clearly that I still do not fully understand the problem well enough that I am able to come up with a solution in plain English. 

- Brian is really patience in walking through the problem, verbalizing his thought process, and coding up a solution to the problem. He even took an extra mile to test the code to make sure it is working properly as expected. 

- I have learned his mindset and attitude whenever he encountered a challenging problem. Thanks to him I realize I definitely need to work on the easy type of problems and focus on practicing my `precoding` skill (including how to understand and come up with a solution in plain English)

- It is so cool to see that he can use his intuition and test out a lot of trials and errors in his mind already.
