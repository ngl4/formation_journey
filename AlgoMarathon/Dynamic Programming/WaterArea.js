Learn Strength Algo: Water Area

Q. Given an array of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the height of a pillar of width 1, the water will be poured over all the pillars. Return the surface area enclosed by these pillars from the front. Spilled water should be ignored. 

Example:
â€¢ Given an array: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]
            |    -> "*" is  water trapped by the pillars
          |*|    -> "|" is the one unit of the height of a pillar
        |*|*|       
        -----
returns 3

Hint: This problem requires the left and right transversal on an array. 
Hint: Finding max is key

/*
Progress Note: 
10 mins: conceptually understand the problem and think of approaches
Thought about iterating through the heights array and then find the highest height in the array
However, I am stuck at how I would be able to look for the second or third largest number on the left side and the right side of the highest pillar 

15mins: Reviewed through Algo Expert video explanation on the problem as well as the approach that is used 

Future Attempt: 
- Make sure to re-explain the concept and record yourself while doing it 
- Code up a solution for the problem 
- Explain the problem in plain English
