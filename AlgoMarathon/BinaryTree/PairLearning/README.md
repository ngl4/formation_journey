# Pair Learning in Algo Marathon 

## Binh Hua (05/12/22)

First time working with Binh to go through this pair learning session. 

We went over the [Level Order Traversal]() problem. A medium Leetcode problem. 

**Reflection**
- Really like the enthusiam of Binh when going through this problem. She learns new approach and applies immediately and this is what I think I learn the most from her. 


## Angel (05/23/22) 

We already had several sessions together and I really like to pair learning Angel since she is always able to pinpoint what I missed in my implementation on a problem. And we always have different perspectives. That is why it is interesting to work with her! 

We went over the [BST to Doubly Linked List In-Order Traversal]() problem using recursive. A medium leetcode problem.

Angel shared with me this resouce on Doubly Linked List: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/doubly-linked-list/

I have found the similar problem on Leetcode [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/)

Great video walkthrough of this problem [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy7I5wcwfh4)

**Reflection**
- Angel is a great host since she is able to ask questions to guide me to go over the part that I may have missed during my implementation. I totally forgot to set head to the first node, which I quickly mentioned during the pseudocode but did not write it down so I missed it entirely until Angel asked me questions and made me realize the problem I made. I like the fact that she did not give me an answer and just ask me questions to let me solve them by myself. 

An additional possible approach to the problem: try to solve it iterativelyâ€¦ (:
