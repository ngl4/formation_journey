# Algo Marathon

Welcome to Level 2 of Algo Blitz!!

## Tips & Tricks

- Don't spend more than 30 mins on a problem

- Learn by Problem Types

- Follow through the Formation Tasks, and practice more on Neetcode, Leetcode (sort by problem type and acceptance rate), AlgoExpert if needed.

- Try to walk through the problem in "English" to understand what it is asking

- Get a big picture/idea of all the data structures and algorithms (knowing generally all the existing tools)

## Data Structure Fundamentals (Big Picture)

**Linear Data Structures**: 
- Array
- Stack 
- Queue
- Linked List 

**Non-linear Data Structures**: 
- Trees 
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
- Graph     
- Trie 
- Heap
    - heap data structure provides an efficient implementation of priority queues

**Other Data Structures**: 
- Hashmap (key-value pair)
- Hashset (object)

### Array 

1. [Time Complexity of the common Js Operations and Methods](https://medium.com/@ashfaqueahsan61/time-complexities-of-common-array-operations-in-javascript-c11a6a65a168)

2. Know what each **Js Built-in Methods** returning in its output through [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

3. Inserting/Removing in Array 

4. Searching in Array 

5. Accessing/Updating in Array 

### Hashmap 


### Hashset (unique)


### Linked List 


### Summary on Array, Linked list, Hashmap, Hashset

Thanks to Mentor Jeremy at Formation who has shared the following table in the first Algo Workout session: 

|  | insertion/removal   | searching/checkingForExistence  | accessing/updating/getValue  | 
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Hashmap | O(1)  | O(1)  | O(1)  | 
| Hashset | O(1)  | O(1)  | O(n)`@` | 
| Array/List |  O(n)`*` | O(n)`#`  | O(1)  | 

`*` = O(1) if you're inserting/removing in the end
`#` = O(1) if the search item is in the first index of the array 
`@` = 

### Trees 


### Trie


### Heap/Priority Queue


### Graph
