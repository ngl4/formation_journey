# Progress

## Week 1: Starting Point

(April 18th - April 24th)

Went over 6 Algo Array related easy+medium problems. Met with some fellows (Jordan and Alexis) in Formation Gather to get to know ways to plan for the Algo Marathon challenge. Unable to solve any problems successfully.

Trying to spend less times on problems, but realized it does not seem to be enough time for me to fully understand the pattern/problem within 30 mins time frame.

## Week 2: Array focused problems + Network with Mentors and Fellows

(April 25th - May 1st)

Went over 5 Algo Array & Strings related easy+medium problems. Tend to spend a little longer than 30 mins on the some medium problems, but no more than 1 hour. Had 1-on-1 with Brian Do to walk over a array two-pointers problem.

I did not feel much progress and would like spent more time on the easy problems. I decided to meet with other fellows and mentors to have coffee hours to ask them about learning strategies.

## Week 3: Array focused problems + Network with Mentors and Fellows (continued)

(May 2nd - May 8th)

Went over 3 Algo Array related problems. Met with Mentor Vinit, Arthur Damm, and Mentor Brian Zhu for 1-on-1 sessions to go over some Array problems as well as learning to observe how the mentors approach problems differently.

I felt pretty productive this week when I get the chance to meet with other mentors and fellows to learn from them. I decided to keep with mentors and fellows in the upcoming week to keep learning from them. (_I did not realize back then that besides learning from 1-on-1 sessions, I have to build up my muscle memory by doing more problems, instead of doing problems with others_). During the week 3 reflection, I have decided to look into Neetcode problems more and go over mutliple problems in a short period of time.

## Week 4: Working through multiple problems + Network with Mentors and Fellows (continued)

Went over 5 Algo Array and Binary Tree related problems this week. Met with Mentor Vinit, Arthur Damm, and Alumni Mitch for 1-on-1 sessions to go over arrays, sliding windows,trees recursion (DFS top down pre-order & bottom up post-order). Attended Algo Blitz mentor office hours with Sophie and it helps to see how Sophie communciated her thought process and approach during interview-like situation.

There is definitely benefit to meeting with mentors and fellows, especially during the DFS session with Arthur Damm, I feel like I start to learn and understand the difference in different DFS traversals.

I felt pretty productive like the past week, but I also realize I still am not able to solve easy or medium problems well when taking the weekly assessments. I still did not know what I need to change to make sure I could make more progress in learning Algo and Data Structures.

## Week 5: Focus on Arrays & Trees + Network with Mentors and Fellows (continued) + Beginning of feeling burned out

This week, my full time workload has increased a decent amount due to a teammate was off due to sickness.

Went over 3 Algo Array and Trees problems this week. Met with Brian Do and Mentor Brian Zhu. Attended sessions at Formation hosted by Tony Nguyen and Kate. Took the weekend off and used the time to recover from feeling burned out.

I have decided in the upcoming week to meet with Mentor Jenny Xing and to catch up and share my learning progress with the mentor. I also decided to take the time to reflect and keep learning each day. Slow things down to see what is holding me back from progressing forward in the Algo Marathon challenge.

## Week 6: Slightly Burned out + Self-Care + Reflection

Learned about Convert Binary Search Tree and Trie Data Structure through pair learning and extra self-learning time. Attended Algo Marathon and asked related questions. Attended Women Who Code CONNECT conference for the entire day on May 26th. Had some great connections there. It was really fun to do the 3 mins networking pairing at the conference. It is amazing to speak with/connect with multiple engineers there.

Super glad I had a Algo Sprint session with Mentor Nam - being able to go back to practice building Js built-in methods ie, map, reduce, filter, some, every functions from scratch AND build them for Linked List Data Structure (instead of array).

Spent the time to do more exercise with my family and self-care throughout the week. Special thanks to Jenny Xing who has reminded me the use of `time constraint` and `visualization` and applying it in my work environment (this can helps me to resolve the issue with `memorization of tools`, placing it around the environment so you can reduce the mental loads when `the key to solving problems is to get more times to solve problems, rather than trying to come up with tools from memory`). Thanks to Sophie who has reminded me the `groundwork` of practicing more is what I needed to move myself forward.

## Week 7: Starting again on the Big Picture

(End of May and Beginning of June)

I have started doing some cheatsheet and mindmapping to help myself better remember some of the tools I have learned. This has been helping me to recall Algo and Data Structure Basic concepts and runtime/space complexity! I have continued to do weekly meeting with different mentors/fellows in the Formation community.

I realized I still have not been improving in my problem-solving skills and realized I have not practiced enough, so I have to work on this in the upcoming week.

## Week 8: Big Picture (cont) + Working through multiple Trees problems

(Beginning of June)

I have continued to work on this on non-linear data structure (focus on trees only) cheatsheet on paper. Focusing on mainly Trees problem on this week!! I started to be able to understand + implement how Trees DFS pre-order, in-order, post-order traversals. I felt like I have started to understand how to work through matrix problems.

I have continued to do weekly meeting with different mentors/fellows in the Formation community.

I have also been reading the Cracking the Coding Interview Book!

## Week 9: Small Study Groups + AH-HA Moment (<-- Passed Mocked Behavior Phone Screens)

This is the week I have started joining some small study groups with Noor and Maria, as well as with Jiyoon, Steven and Eric. They are a lot of fun and I have grown better in my problem solving skills through learning in a small group and we are going through problems in marathon style.

I had an office hours with Mentor Nic on Binary Tree, It was a super helpful session because I finally realize and understand what `pattern` really means and to set up general `templates` for multiple algo concepts or tools. This can ease in memorization and also can be super helpful in using the template to solve multiple similar problems. I like this office hours a lot!!

I have discussed with my Fellow Manager Nashira that I would like to start Live Coding, Mocked Phone Interview challenges at the same time since my progress has been progressing not as fast as expected in the Algo Marathon. I am glad I take more times in going through Marathon because it is super crucial to brush up on my basics and to be able to make sure I can work on most easy and some medium problems.

During this week, I have passed the Binary Tree and the Linked List subchallenge! Glad I have made some progress in the Marathon journey!!!

Using Friday to Sunday, I have passed the Mocked Phone Interview Challenge after 2 trials which has given me some confidence to move forward. I have also had a Mocked Live Coding Interview with Kevin, but I did not pass.

## Week 10: Small Study Groups + Self-Study (<-- This week I have also started Live Coding Challenge)

- Failed 3 live coding sessions so far ~ but I have learned a ton from each sessions!
- Practiced through Recursive problems and Matrixes problems
- Studied in small group with Brian Do, Amy Back, Jiyoon Koo, Steven Zhu on Group Anagrams problem

## Week 12: Live Coding (1 passed 1 failed) + Algo Marathon (recursion)

Keep working through Algo problems on Recursion mainly. 

I have 3 live coding sessions with Mentor Thomas and Mentor Stan Liu this week - I have passed Thomas assessment but failed Stan's one. I have learned a lot from all these sessions on what I need to work on to improve my live coding skillsets. 

## Week 13: Live Coding (1 passed 1 failed) + Algo Marathon (recursion)

Keep working through different Algo problems (focus on passing the Algo Recursion challenge). 

I have 2 live coding sessions and one with Mentor Jenny and the other one with Mentor Erik Ritter. I have also passed Erik one but failed Jenny's one. 

First time attending John Mendez's office hours on Frontend this week!! 

I had pair learning with Si Young Byun on Matrix Multiply!! 

## Week 14: Algo Marathon (focus on practicing Strength Algos)

Focus on practicing Strength Algo problems and start drawing out some simple visualization to help to remember the Algo problem solving patterns. Took 3 Algo Marathon Assessments this week. 

When going through Algo Workout with Vinit (Trie + autocomplete), I realize I still need to practice this data structure and revisit recursion!!

Had a pair learning session on Kandane's algo and learned from Keng-Yu! ~ I like how he went over the 

## Week 15: Live Coding (failed) + Algo Marathon (passed)

Finally, I have passed the Algo Marathon challenge this week!!! Took 1 Algo Marathon Assessment! 

What I learned from Algo Workout session with Mentor Hanzel Ong: 
- Knowing the general Interview Rubrics 
- Knowing the type of edge cases or follow up questions that could be asked by the interviewer 

Amazing Live Coding Session with Jenny to go over a Full Stack problem (focus on Frontend): 
- Reviewed thorugh all the folders from `top down approach` ie, for a React project, starting from `index.js` -> `app.js` -> `pages` folder -> `components` folder
- When starting to work on the implementation, start to apply `bottom up approach` to work my way up, ie, when you need to display a box of items, then start looking at the items, then the box, and then slowly work my way up! 

Insightful and Motivational Women's FRG Check-in: 
- Kendallene, Gigi, Maria, Kelly, and many other ladies who have shared a lot of their experiences during this session and I have learned so much from them!! 
- Stand up for yourself and be your own best advocate! 
- Take the initiative to ask tough and hard questions to find out about the companies' management style, DEI, as well as life work balance

Pair learning with Fellow Gigi 
- learning to understand problems better 
- learning to explain what I have known 
- learning to debug under pressure 

Other Progress made this week (Feeling really grateful for being able to connnect with these connections): 
- Had 3 1-on-1 coffee hours with professionals in network - Priya, Zoe, and Soojung!!
- Had an amazing coffee hours with Fellow Alum Jordan Leslie 
- Had an amazing Algo discussion and caught up with Fellow Alum Brian Do
