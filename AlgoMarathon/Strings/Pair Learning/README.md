# Pair Learning 

## Carlos Portillo (04/28/22)
We went over the [problem on implement strStr](https://github.com/ngl4/formation_journey/blob/main/AlgoMarathon/Strings/Pair%20Learning/implementStrstrwCarlos.js). A slightly simplier algo problem. Carlos was a great host and he did well int he following:

1. Identify and Ask follow up questions to help the pair learning fellow instead of just providing an answer, ie, the `.slice()` method (possible how it works behind the scene - if it is coded from scratch...), would it be the same to use `<=` is better than `= ... +1` in the second condition of the for loop `for (c1; c2; c3)` for this problem. 

2. Able to explain and show a good understanding of the Time and Space Complexity of my solution to the problem. I have learned more about he explained it, which is better than what I have done. (Time: `O(gt)`, Space: `O(t)`) ~ `g: given string, t: target string`

3. Clearly and concisely walk through the visualization of the optimal solution (Time: `O(gt)`, Space: `O(1)`) to the problem. He had `a good pace when explaining the problem`. Here is the `visualization` he did and I think it is really straightforward when visualizing the problem: 
```js
/*
Time: O(gt) | Space: O(1)
i = 1, j = 1
"hello", target: "ello"
  i

 given[i + j] = l
 target[j] = l

 */
```

I have had a great session with Carlos and learned something new from him. The biggest takeaway from this session is to be `constantly asking questions and being curious` on `why the programmer has chosen to approach the problem in a certain way` ~ even we may or may not come up with an answer, it is still good that we have thought and had a deeper discussion on the problem rather than simply just working to get a corret solution only. We also got the chance to get to know each other a little more at the end of the session. (in terms of our interest area)
