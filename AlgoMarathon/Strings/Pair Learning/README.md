# Pair Learning 

## Carlos Portillo (04/28/22)
We went over the [problem on implement strStr](https://github.com/ngl4/formation_journey/blob/main/AlgoMarathon/Strings/Pair%20Learning/implementStrstrwCarlos.js). A slightly simpler algo problem. Carlos was a great host and he did well in the following:

Identify and Ask follow up questions to help the pair learning fellow instead of just providing an answer, ie, the .slice() method (possible how it works behind the scene - if it is coded from scratch...), would it be the same to use <= is better than = ... +1 in the second condition of the for loop for (c1; c2; c3) for this problem.

Able to explain and show a good understanding of the Time and Space Complexity of my solution to the problem. (Time: O(gt), Space: O(t)) ~ g: given string, t: target string

Clearly and concisely walk through the visualization of the optimal solution (Time: O(gt), Space: O(1)) to the problem. He had a good pace when explaining the problem. Here is the visualization he did and I think it is really straightforward when visualizing the problem:

```js
/*
Time: O(gt) | Space: O(1)
i = 1, j = 1
"hello", target: "ello"
  i

 given[i + j] = l
 target[j] = l

 */
 ```

I have had a great session with Carlos and learned something new from him. The biggest takeaway from this session is to be constantly asking questions and being curious on why the programmer has chosen to approach the problem in a certain way ~ even if we may or may not come up with an answer, it is still good that we have thought and had a deeper discussion on the problem rather than simply just working to get a correct solution only. We also got the chance to get to know each other a little more at the end of the session. (in terms of our interest area)

This is the best session I have had. I have learned a ton a ton from Arthur!! He is amazing! Based on how Arthur explains a problem, it helps me to understand how he thinks of an approach and how he pseudocode the problem. I have a marvelous experience during this session. 

**Takeaways**: 
- Balance out `the time spent to look at a bunch of problems to identify the common pattern with a problem type` (ie, Array, Stack, Tree, Linked List, Recursion, etc.) and `the time spent on solving and implementing the problem using the engineering methods` 
  - For instance, 5mins approach, 5-10mins reviewed through the solutions - for identifying general pattern in a problem type
  - And 15-30mins applied the engineering methods on a particular problem - to assess and make sure you have fully understood a problem type 

- `Understanding` and `Memorizing` are both necessary when learning the patterns of each problem type or algorithms. You need to memorize in order to support your understanding, and similarly through understanding, it helps you to remember. 

- When you are stucked, you can walk through your thought process and `state your thought`, and `ask` the interviewer, `if you are on the right track`. 

- Learning DSA requires us to learn the principle (pattern) and then know how to practice (implement) them

- `Lee215` is one of the Leetcode members who would always provide a solution to a Leetcode problem in multiple languages ~ Arthur finds his answer to be really helpful!!

- Python, JavaScript (interpreted language, fast to process, but slower to run), Java (compiled language - once updated, run fast)
