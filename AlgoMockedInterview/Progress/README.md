# Progress

## Week 1: Starting Point
(July 25th)

**Progress made:** 
- Live Coding (Keep practicing) - working through the Weather API, async/await, promise.then (fetching Data and displaying Data using React Hooks)
    - Had a live coding session with Jenny (vanilla Js, fetching API Data/displaying on DOM)
        - I did not perform so well in this session 
        - I was too focus in working through the problem and did not communicate much 
        - My speed is still slow 
        - However, at least, I could fetch the API Data successfully and that is a good first step! 
        - I realized seeing a big picture is key! - I should be able to mention quickly in 1 sentence what the task is about and what the problem is and what I need to do. Quickly write down some goals so you have an idea on what you need to do!
    - Worked on Weather API exercise suggested by Mentor Michael Novati 
        - Tried to work on it under 2 hours 
        - Shared my draft in Mattermost regarding my progress and asked for feedbacks
        - Created 2 drafts so far on the Weather API 
        - Mentor John Mendez provided several feedbacks and pinpointed me on concepts I should practice and review more!! 

- Algo Marathon (Keep practicing) - reviewing and practicing basic Trees problems 
    - Self-practicing: going through some Trees problem and try to do them within 20-30 mins. I did not do a lot this week 
- Algo Mocked Interview (Beginning) - took initial assessment on advanced array -> N-Queens problem (Array + Backtracking) - failed - I spent a ton of time to understand this hard problem. I have not thought of an approach to solve the problem 

**Coffee Hours:**
- Lena Kwon 

**Attended Formation Event:** 
- Understanding Engineering Levels in Tech 

**Reflection** 
- What I did well? 
    - Worked on my mindset and learned to face interviews with more relaxing mindset 
        - It is okay to moving at my pace and make sure to learn the most out of every interview 
        - Prepare to break my own previous record of how I performed and did my best to make sure I have improved 
        - `What is the worst thing happens if you fail, you fail and you move on with a better idea of how you could improve to prepare yourself for future interviews!!` 
        - You can do it! Cindy! 
        - `Find the world, environment, and people that are opening up to who I am, what I could bring, how I feel, what I value, and who I can grow into with this new world, new environment, and working with these new amazing people! ~ I am not sure what it is like now, but I am sure I will find it with faith, patience, continuous improvement, enthusiasm, belief and hope!` 
        
    - Listened to my body and Took the necessary break for my body to recover from the heavy workload throughout the week from work 
    - Went to the park 4 times this week to release my anxiety from work and study 
    - Spent a great decent amount of time on Saturday relaxing 
    - Worked on weather API exercise and asked for mentor's feedback to improve in my understanding of data fetching and displaying. Mostly have focused mainly on the fetching aspect. 
    - Start to have made some speed improvement when coding out the inputs (type=text, value, onChange) in React (which took me a long period of time before)

- What I can improve? 
Haha many things but I will tackle them one at a time: 
    - Frontend: 
        - Make sure I have fully understood all the basic & complex concepts in Javascript/React and able to explain them out loud - async/await, promise/then, closure, etc. 
    - Algo: 
        - Trees and Recursion are still what I need to work on improving 
            - Knowing the basics of different types of traversals (when to pick which?)
            - iterative vs recursive approaches (pros and cons) 
            - Time/space complexity in using recursive approach
            - Thought process in thinking about Recursion 
            - Possible Templates built up for both Basic Trees and Recursion 
            - Visualization and walking through the problems recursively 
        - Knowing when to use `a helper function` and when to use a plain function and add an additional `parameter`? (I was awared of this after having a study session with Dana and Amy Back)

**Goals for the upcoming week** 
- Going through multiple Algo Trees and Recursive problems until I have understood the patterns (dig deeper to see how to resolve some follow up questions!!)
- Making some more progress in my JXT project (start working on the design aspect) ~ still need to figure out the internal server issue for one of the accounts. 
        
## Week 2: Algo Intensive (Trees + Recursion)
- I have been doing Frontend and practiced live coding earlier this week 
- I only got the chance to practice a little of Algos this week (Trees and Recursion)
- Going through the basics to build up the second nature in solving basics problem 
- Continue in the hunt 

## Week 3 and 4: System Design + Algo + Live Coding 
- Progressing through different practices 
- Continue with the hunt 

## Week 5: System Design + Frontend Live Coding + Algo 
- Learning more about System Design and its use cases 
    - Design Shazam
    - Design Facebook Event/Evite
- Going through some frontend practices 
    - movie list
    - bank transaction 
- Going through some recursive problems 
- I still need to build up my confidence in solving different types of problems. It gets overwhelming especially I need to make sure I have built up my skillsets for 3 different areas. 
- Take break/rest is key to move foward!! 

Goals: 
- Learn to build reusable component 
- Learn to approach problems in more than 1 way especially in recursion 
- Go through React Basics 
- Go through Javascript Basics 
- Go through HTML/CSS Basics - Accessbility
