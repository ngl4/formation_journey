## Week 1: Starting Point
(July 25th)

Live Coding (Keep practicing) - working through the Weather API, async/await, promise.then
Algo Marathon (Keep practicing) - reviewing and practicing basic Trees problem 
Algo Mocked Interview (Beginning) - took initial assessment on advanced array -> Queens problem (Array + Backtracking) - failed - I spent a ton of time to understand this hard problem. I have not thought of an approach to solve the problem
