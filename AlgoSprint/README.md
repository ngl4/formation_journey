# Algo Sprint

## Nam (05/27/22) on Reduce, Map, Fitler, Some, Every Functions - Scratch in Linked List

There are only 2 fellows in this session, but I feel like I am able to participate more and learn more when the session is smaller, especially on Algo Sprint. 

**Reflection**
- I still need to keep practicing the basics and make sure I can explain my thought process and higher level approach well. Most importantly, I need to work on implementation. 
- Through this session, I know that I need to start `recording` or video recording (either way works) myself more often and listen back to how I communciate. This helps me to know if I am able to fully understand what I am talking about. I want to know if I am an interviewer, would I be able to follow through what I say. 
- Thanks to Nam who has been guiding and giving hints to help me to understand the problem and the implementation. I really like his mentoring style. He is able to explain the problem using `visualization` really well. It is really helpful to me to learn from my mistakes and know `why` it is a mistake. He is also really good at giving feedback on `how we communicate`, I have not put a lot of thought in this and I think being aware of this through this session helps me to know how I change my learning style. 
- Nam is really good at manually testing the code, I have not seen how it was done before and it is the first time seeing a mentor walking through how manual testing can be done.
    - I need to learn to identify based on the implementation - if it is working or not. 

**Takeaways**
- Make sure to practice to understand all the fundamental Js methods well, know what they are returning (array, object, booleans, string, etc.)
- Make sure I can implement these methods in `different data structures` besides array
- Make sure to be able to build out these methods `from scratch` 
- `Verbalize` what I think
- `Manual testing` the code is a key skill to have
