Takeaways: 
- `When there are constraints, focus on your values and strength`
- Sophie Advice on Job Searching: 
    1. Companies are taking leveling more seriously 
        - focus more on system design is key 
    2. Past Experience 
        - focus on presenting and promoting yourself to the public

- It is okay to take the time to figure out what you want 
    - find any possible ways to help you to get into your desired companies 
- In terms of learning, think of yourself as a Founding Team member. Take Risk, pressure on learning, start something from ground zero
- `WHAT YOU WANT` is key for job searching 
    - FIGURE OUT your STRENGTH and what you want to work on 
- Companies are looking for `Good Fit People` and they want the people they hire can follow the engineering team structure! 
- If you are interested in and building social app? 
    - Learn to build a news feed
    - Learn to build a prototype for a messenger app
    - building anything practical is the best way to prepare for social app companies ie, Facebook, NextDoor, etc. 
- `PICK THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY` IS IMPORTANT 
    - invest in yourself 
    - find a role that matches your passion 
    - invest in your network 
    - where you start can impact and determine where you finish 
- WHERE IS YOUR `EXCITEMENT` AND WHERE CAN YOU `PUT YOUR ENERGY IN THE WORLD`? 
- `FINDING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE`
    - you can then lead with purpose and be on the driver seat 
    - authenticity will show when you are doing what you like the most 
    - Look into your `Ikigai` - key part of ikigai requires a concrete action that leads you closer to the meaningful goal to you. Everyone is different, so `what is your purpose in life? what do you want to do in your next role?` 


## Formation Day - 10/01/2022

Attended 4 events at Formation: 
(1) Engineering Method with Daniel 
(2) Algo Studio with Daniel 
(3) Algo Studio Session with Jeremy and Sophie 
(4) Algo Code Drill Session with Sophie 

Really helpful and knowledgable sessions. Even though I still need to work on my speed in understanding a problem and be able to fully understand what it means and what it is about. 

Takeaways: 
- Ask relevant questions to the problem 
- Take the time to explore the problem 
- Make sure to document down my high level understanding in plain English and not in Code
- Make sure to fully understood the problem and make sure to have an insight on all the possible test cases (happy and edge cases) as well as knowing the input and output of the problem
- It is okay in the interview that the interviewer has helped you. It would be great if you could solve the problem on your own through communicating with the interviewer, but if the interviewer can sense that you are stuck, a good intervewer will step in to make sure you can learn something from the session and able to give more guidance.
