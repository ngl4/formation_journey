# Professional Coffee Hours

## [David Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidho4/) - Senior IT Executive Based in California (06/07/22)

I have found David through Linkedin Connection. I am really glad to hear from his story and to be able to learn from his perspectives in IT leadership, job market, product dev ideas.

**Takeaways**

- Ask yourself `what do you really want to do?` - there are a lot of routes to take - what do you want to do day-to-day?

- Build a profile with the things you like to do and what you want to do -> Takes small steps (ie, attend conferences and connect with companies to get to know different type of people in the network)

- Look for jobs -> a number games (we just need the ONE)

- Chinese say - we are `riding a cow until we find a horse` - maybe at some points in our life, the horse we preceive will evetually becomes a cow again. The reason is our perception changes over time due to our experience.

- Company researching - do not want to waste too much time on it until you secure some type of confirmation ie, phone call or interview. Then you will start to do more research on the company to be more prepared.

  - Personally, I think I should at least have a basic understanding of companies or type of companies I am interested in and do some research on them to see if they are just as what I expected.

- `Create a range of criteria of companies you want to work for` - ie, size of the company, team environment, collaborative or full ownership, mentorship, etc. - this can help you to know what companies you can reject before even committing more time on them.

- `Don't be afraid to switch jobs` - as long as you have the choice without so much of the financial burden, this can give you a chance to explore the different opportunities out there before you settle down in one area!

- `Pain points` and `Solutions to the pain points` are the key to a successful product development. It does not come out of nowhere. It starts from helping others to solve a problem and then slowly when there are more people are looking for people to solve the similar problem, this is when `a market` emerges.

- David Ho knew exactly since he was young that he was interested in computer science. Starting from `2 way pager` to getting an internship in technology. He shows his passion in solving bigger problems. He has worked for different sizes of companies.

- Down the road, he needed to pick a path in between `management` and `technical expert`, and the decided to pursue the management route since he has experienced working in this particular area.

- There are plenty of jobs. There are plenty of companies that are more picky than before. But still a lot of opinions can be pretty opinionated so `dont feel like you are not good enough, a lot of time it is a subjective choice from the company`

In short based on the disucssion, it definetely has helped me to reflect on the journey ahead of me:

- You are riding a cow now, so make the use of it to help you to find the next faster cow or could be a horse!

- IT IS CRUICAL TO REMEMBER YOU CANNOT CHANGE HOW OTHERS THINK ABOUT YOU, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS TO BE ABLE TO BE MENTALLY `PREPARED` FOR YOURSELF. DO WHAT YOU CAN. CHOOSE TO MOVE ON AND KEEP GOING IN THE PATH YOU HAVE CHOSEN.

- KEEP GOING AND LOOK FORWARD!
