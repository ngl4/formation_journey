# Monday Words of Wisdom 

Every Monday on each week, Formation will have a quick 15 mins meeting to make anouncements and to send positive tips, vibes to all the fellows.

Every since I have started Formation, I have noted down what I have learned each of these brief meetings. 

# Technical Learning & Interview

## _"Learning at all Cost"_
- Try to make the most out of every experience!! 
- Try to make sure you learn something new at all cost from each interview! 

1. Ask Questions? 
    - For problems you have not successfully solved, ask the interviewer how do they do it and how to approach the problem? 
2. Research Before walking into an interview
    - Know what the company does well in 
    - How they handle different situations

- Keep asking lots of questions!! There is no harm asking more so you can have more context that can help you to prepare for your future interviews. 

## _"Interview Skills - How you approach, solve, communicate, and make decisions are what matter!!"_ 

Here are what you are being assessed as a software engineer during a technical interview: 

- How you are going to behave as a member of a team? 
- How you are going to solve the problem? 
- How you handled a sudden problem or a problem you have not seen before, how you would still able to go over and possibly solve it? 
- How you are making decisions as an engineer? and why you are picking a certain approach over another? 

## _"Compile vs Non-Compile Coding Interview"_

- Ask Recuriters detailed Questions, ie, what is the coding environment? is it going to be compiled or non-compiled environment? is it using Coderpad or other platform? 

```
Advantages and Disadvantages of Compiled Environment: (ie, Coderpad)

Pros: more test cases (+ edge cases) 

Cons: unexpected error from the compiler
```
```
Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-compiled Environment: (ie, Whiteboarding)

Pros: 
- not precise in syntax 
- we can "assume" the use of a helper function that functions as expected 
- can dig deeper in the problem solving 

Cons:
- Fewer test cases 
```

## _"Learning Mode vs Interviewing Mode"_ 
- Learning Mode: 
    - Longer time spent and can be more than expected 
    - Rabbit holes 
- Interviewing Mode: 
    - Expect to be 10x faster than learning mode 
    - Work well under high pressue time limit 
- Pair Learning Session (@ Formation): 
    - Take it slow 
    - Focus on explaining the concepts, examples, going through the problem step-by-step 
    - Make sure students are walking away of the session with more confidence 
- Pair Interviewing Session (@ Formation): 
    - start with a concise summary 
    - the host should be well prepared for the session and perform just as an interviewer 
    - Time limit + interview intensive environment

## _"Engineering Arguments or Debate is highly encouraged"_ 
- If you have a strong opinion on a particular engineering practice, debate about it to win the argument!

## _"Follow the Engineering Method - why follow the flow?"_
- The structure of the engineering method helps you to see problems from `abtract to details` 
- When taking the high level overview step, it can help you to slowly move down 1 level of detail at a time 
- Under the high stress interview situation, if you jump too quickly in code, you will have a hard time to see things in a higher level
- It is `better` to understand in details before coding from high level overview and walks down one level at a time, because it is `harder to go backward from coding back to higher level overview`.

# Job Hunting & Preparation

## _"Job Hunt - Response Time to Recruiters - 24 hrs"_ 
- Business happens fast and it does not wait - so it is crucial to respond to Recruiters message as soon as you have received them. This also gives others a better impression on you. It also show you are serious in the job hunting process. 
- Being accountable with your career coach and make sure communicate any changes (career preferences) ahead of time
