## Create a SSH Key

How to create a SSH Key? and What is a SSH key? 

Here are the resources I have used: 
- [Setting Up SSH Keys for GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X4u9sca3Io)
    - This video is a great intro to SSH key and guide you through how to create a SSH Key 
- [How to Generate SSH Keys for GitHub](https://kinsta.com/blog/generate-ssh-key/)
    - This article goes into the details and I would highly suggest to quickly read through it to get a better idea how the SSH key is generated and the meaning behind the commands

### npm start - Encountered SyntaxError?! 

- If you ever encountered a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error after doing `npm install`, don't panic! You just have to make sure to install the latest node version `nvm install [NEW NODE VERSION]` then you should be able to resolve the problem. Remember to install the LTS node version from [the node.js site](https://nodejs.org/en/).
