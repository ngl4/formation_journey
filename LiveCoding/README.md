## Stanley Liu (06/22/2022)

We did a basic CSS problem within the React environment (input JSON file -> generate a grid in the React DOM).

**Good Practice**

- Use a global variable (all capitalized) ie, `UNIT` that was used repetitive throughout the script

**Reflection**
There were some guidance from the interviewer to guide me through time when I was stuck.
I did well in identifying errors, but I was not able to resolved it well. I also think when I realized the use of `UNIT` should be applied in the positioning of the children gridbox.

**Takeaways**
I need to improve on the following:

- Brush up on my JavaSCript - be stronger in `string interpolation`, know what context does it make sense to use certain methods, or how the curly bracket is used in the React framework.
- Communication - `order of operation` matters when communicating through the approach <- I got a similar advice on this when going through an Algo Sprint with Nam before. I noticed this issue that I think I need to work on to resolve. The specific example Stanley pointed out was when I was talking about `gridContainer` variable, I was not clear that at the beginning that it would be used to pass into the style of a div tag. I mentioned it later on which has already caused the interview to feel confused on what my intention was when I created the variable.
  - Use the communication during the interview to convey more
