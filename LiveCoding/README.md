**Feedbacks & Takeaways**

```
Areas to improve:
Overall, your outline and structure of the interview was good! You laid out and discussed your approach, structured your HTML, and thoughtfully named your CSS selectors. However, time management was the biggest issue here as we ran out of time to showcase your entire skillset. Although not completing an interview solution is not automatically a “no” in every case, you want to present as much “evidence” as possible that you would be a good candidate for this role and you have good time management skills when approaching a problem.

What Went Well
Good discussion and outline of the problem solution
Structured your HTML and CSS well
Great communication in your thought process

What Could Use Improvement
Time management is the biggest one, everything was looking promising, we just ran out of time
Practice quickly making layouts, learning how to center things in different situations, etc. Practice the skills you will likely be doing in every design interview so they are second-nature to you

## Stanley Liu (06/22/2022)

We did a basic CSS problem within the React environment (input JSON file -> generate a grid in the React DOM).

**Good Practice**

- Use a global variable (all capitalized) ie, `UNIT` that was used repetitive throughout the script

**Reflection**
There were some guidance from the interviewer to guide me through time when I was stuck.
I did well in identifying errors, but I was not able to resolved it well. I also think when I realized the use of `UNIT` should be applied in the positioning of the children gridbox.

**Feedbacks & Takeaways**
I need to improve on the following:

- Brush up on my JavaSCript - be stronger in `string interpolation`, know what context does it make sense to use certain methods, or how the curly bracket is used in the React framework.
- Communication - `order of operation` matters when communicating through the approach <- I got a similar advice on this when going through an Algo Sprint with Nam before. I noticed this issue that I think I need to work on to resolve. The specific example Stanley pointed out was when I was talking about `gridContainer` variable, I was not clear that at the beginning that it would be used to pass into the style of a div tag. I mentioned it later on which has already caused the interview to feel confused on what my intention was when I created the variable.
  - Use the communication during the interview to convey more

```
Areas to improve:

Fewer JS syntax mistakes
Remove unnecessary layers of abstraction (extra function)
Faster at solving bugs (position, top + right / left mixup, height + width, etc.)

Pros
Really kind and open communicator. Really receptive to feedback and learning
Able to come up with a working valid solution

Cons
Could improve articulation of some points (ex/ say I want to create an obj to pass to div style attr, before writing the style obj)
Could improve speed and efficiency of solving some bugs

Suggestions
Brush up on JS and JSX syntax
Study CSS position attributes and their uses
Learn to debug issues fasters

## Matt Oates (06/23/22)

**Feedbacks & Takeaways**

```
Areas to improve:
Needed to be unblocked a few times.

Feedback:
Some rustiness with object destructuring.
Over-engineering of a simple dropdown UI, and rusty with manipulating document flow.
Spent most of our time on the basic naive implementation and did not have time to talk about rich topics such as race conditions + debouncing.
```

## 06/26/22 Progress

- Reviewed over Checkbox task from Formation to prepare for the pair learning session

## Jenny Xing (07/05/22) - Vanilla Js, HTML, CSS

- I did not do so well in the frontend session with Jenny today. I realized I made the mistake on coding too early which has caused me to not knowing what to do in the middle of the interview. It took me too long to get through a small section and I have been doing more `console.log` than expected.

Here are suggestions from Jenny:

```
try to thoroughly explore your ideas at the beginning, and have a clear sense of what you’re going to do before writing down code. it might help you specifically to write out a lot of pseudo code and function signatures to plan out the entire app, and then writing code afterwards.

try to familiarize yourself with the document API and vanilla javascript when it comes to manipulating the dom. getElementsByClassName, querySelectorAll, etc.

The index idea was definitely right- make sure to explore an option sufficiently before throwing it out the window.

try to use string interpolation when possible

try to improve the speed of execution/coding

try to think in more general terms/how to extend the code

try to think in terms of individual functions/what are the reuseable/repeating functions that happen

```
